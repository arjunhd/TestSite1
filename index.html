        tag since italics only modifies the look of the text whereas the
        <em></em> emphasis tag stresses the marked out part in the element;
        It is more important to focus on structuring the text rather than
        focusing on how it looks ; Similarly the <b> or bold tag gives just
        the bold appearance whereas the <strong> tag confers greater importance
        to the text that is marked</strong></b>-->
